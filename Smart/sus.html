                            <h3>What is a Smart City?</h3>
                            <p >
                                A smart city uses Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as a framework to promote sustainable development practices.
                                A technologically modern area which connects ICT and various physical devices to the Internet of things (IoT). The IoT is a network that optimizes the efficiency of city operations and services.<br>
                                <br>
                                There are a number of things that makes a city 'smart'.The city should be able to make optimal use of the interconnected information available today to better understand and control its operations and optimise the user of limited resources.
                                <br>
                                The IoT is reponsible for communicating with other devices and exchanging data, this can include anything such as vehicles or on-street sensors.
                
                                <br>
                                
                
                                Smart cities also use other technologies such as AI (Artificial intelligence), Machine Learning, Mesh Networks, Communication between machines etc.

                <h3>Green Buildings</h3>
                <p>A green building is designed in such a way that eliminates negative impacts and makes more efficient use of resources. Such as efficient use of energy sources, maintaining good air quality etc. Construction should be performed with use of materials that are non-toxic, ethical and sustainable. Rooftop gardens or vegetation on the side of buildings to help insulation, absorb Carbon Dioxide and produce oxygen. This may depend on climatic conditions of an area.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Perimeter Acces Control</h3>
                <p>Controlling access and monitoring of restricted areas with CCTC, intruder detection and alarms. Security cameras are important for securing and viewing the property so that it can act as a warning for intruders and record the identification. The access control such as a keycard is to keep that intruder out of the property. Every building in a smart city should have this compulsory so that crime rates are efficiently reduced.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Efficient Energy Usage</h3>
                <p>Energy efficiency is the goal to drastically reduce the amound required to provide for daily needs. One way to do this is by using renewable energy sources that never run out and are available naturally. Ex : Wind energy from Windmills. Energy generation has a lot of side effects which are harmful for the environment, it is also great for the economy and your wallet since the alternatives are usually cheaper and easier to harvest the energy from.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Building Management</h3>
                <p>Automation and optimisation of services such as heating, energy usage, lighting and ventilation. This is mainly for convenience and comfort. Building management should also mean planning each building and it's placement. Counter-ubranization of Sub-Urbanization (People moving their settlements to the outskirts or even outside of a city) could be used to tackle it since central parts of the city are usually more populated. </p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Air Pollution Control</h3>
                <p>Controlling Carbon Dioxide emissions of factories and monitoring pollution levels caused by harmful gases and dust. The techniques employed to reduce the harmful emissions in the atmosphere include a lot of factors, including burning fossil fuels to avoid the greenhouse effect which may cause acid rain and pollute the air with greenhouse gases.</p>

                <h3>Waste Management</h3>
                <p>Monitoring rubbish levels in containers to optimise refuse collection routes. Keep in mind that waste is generated from several sources and that there are two types of waste, Biodegradable (The waste which can be decomposed by the action of microorganisms is called biodegradable waste.) and Non-diodegradable waste(The wastes which cannot be decomposed easily are called non-biodegradable wastes. These wastes do not undergo rotting). The non-biodegradable waste is the problem here. since it doesn't rot, humans have found many ways to recycle and reuse, basically manage this waste. </p>

                <h3>Smart Parking</h3>
                <p>Energy Consumption monitoring and management. Smart Parking works closely to provide a solution to the modern problem of chaos and lack of management in parking spaces. This can be beneficial for all types of businesses and structures in general such as Airports, Councils, Shoppind centres etc.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>WI-FI</h3>
                <p>Wi- Fi is the wireless technology used to connect devices to the internet. Citywide free WI-FI for public use, including public transport should be provided. A challenge that stands is to connect all the available Wi-Fi to and ISP(Internet Service Provider) which will link the network to the main framework of the internet. This can be overcome by using a commerical ISP which have widespread gateways and access points.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Fire Safety</h3>
                <p>Planning each and every design to be suitable for reducing the risk of fire or impending the spread of it is surely a challenge. Fire detection and intelligent extenguising tailored to each room will help combat this problem. Fire risk assessments can be taken after a building has been made. Training the residents in fire extinguishers, fire alarm and emergency evacuation procedures would help them to deal with this situation until rescue arrives. And the storage of flammable and hazardous materials should be carried out securely along with compliance to local building and electrical safety codes.</p>

            <h3>Reliable Security?</h3>
            <b><u><p class="subtitle">Are smart cities secure?</p></u></b>
            <p>Yes, smart cities are secure. They offer plenty of benefits to improve citizen safety and can protect themselves from data theft and make sure that the accuracy and efficiency of the reported and stored data is proper. Datails available in real time and data is very confidential and easily accessible if on the whitelist. </p>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <h3>What are the challenges faced by a smart city?</h3>
            
            <p>Sustainability is an important variable to consider when designing a smart city, the efficiency in urban areas and welfare of citizens play a part in this. This depends mainly on geography and climate since some areas may have more resources and smaller geographical footprints. The use of fossil fuels to power them would take us back to square one.Thus, alternatives such as using renewable energy and electic vehicles have come into play. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Back to the main question, smart cities need participation from citizens for private and public sectors to align with residents to meet their needs properly. The information stored in smart cities and the placcing is spread out on a white area which makes energy efficiency lower and consumption much higher. Making it harder to develop infrastructure and implement the use of IoT, since devices need to connect in unison this will need very powerful servers. It's only a matter of time till the demand increases.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
           
            
            <h3> Conclusion</h3>
            
            <p>Creating a smart city comes with many benefits for citizens and the government, too. Citizens get improved quality of life while the government gets more energy efficiency, leading to less costs and better use of resources. </p>
